      <title>GSoC - Middle of Week 4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A LOT has happened during the week 2 and 3. I have even managed to work on the project while waiting for the doctor in a hospital emergency room. Long story short: I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty busy lately, at least yesterday was this year&amp;rsquo;s last lecture for me and now I only have to pass 2 exams and that will be it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Github reports 43 commits, 5,005 additions and 2,839 deletions from my side in the master branch of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/b1101/systemgo&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;. The last comit was done 3 days ago and I am oficially stuck. I am not stuck in the sense that I do not know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to do, I am stuck in the sense that I do not know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do it &lt;strong&gt;properly&lt;/strong&gt;. Currently I think that almost all of the structural decisions I came up with are totally useless and need to be redone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues is that I want to make stuff &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;, but the closer I get to implementing &lt;strong&gt;Systemd&lt;/strong&gt; functionality, the more I am forced to do things &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemd&lt;/strong&gt; way&lt;/em&gt;. Actually, now it seems that there is really no other way of doing it given &lt;strong&gt;Systemd&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;monolithicity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GSoC - End of First Week</title>
      <link>https://b1101.github.io/post/week1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first week of GSoC is over. Turned out to be kind of long for me, as I could not wait until Monday and started working on Saturday evening already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes pretty well, I&amp;rsquo;d say. Already managed to rewrite a lot of code I initially wrote, but units get properly parsed and some of them even get started, but most importantly I now know exactly what my next steps should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues for me is coming up with a proper structure. I spend most of my time sitting with a pen and a paper, drawing and trying to understand, how should everything be connected, how shall I organize it. The code itself seems to be really straight-forward, though. I hope now I came up with a structure that somewhat makes sense. I already see things that could(should) be changed/improved, but currently I decided to move forward and then come back to organization, when more stuff works and the requirements are clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I&amp;rsquo;m pretty new to Golang &amp;ndash; this is only my 2nd experience with it. The first one was a research project I worked on for 1.5 weeks before the start of GSoC. I found the interface-based inheritance in Go to be really interesting concept, it really does make you think forward and structure everything properly and, while I still miss some of the &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; inhertitance features(I can&amp;rsquo;t stop wanting 1 method on the parent &amp;lsquo;class&amp;rsquo;, which all the children would inherit, for example), it seems to be somewhat &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; and I start to like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, the Go standard library and tooling are incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GSoC 2016 - Introduction</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Roman, I am a First-year Software Science Bachelor student at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tue.nl/en/&#34;&gt;TU/e&lt;/a&gt;. This summer I am going to work on implementation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6227933760847872&#34;&gt;init and IPC systems&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/plasma-umass/browsix&#34;&gt;Browsix&lt;/a&gt;, which is a project developed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://plasma.cs.umass.edu/&#34;&gt;PLASMA-UMass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bpowers.net/&#34;&gt;Bobby Powers&lt;/a&gt; is going to be my mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if all of that was not &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;cool&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; enough - I&amp;rsquo;m going to write in &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-project&#34;&gt;The project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The init system is intended to make using Browsix in development easier. An additional goal is making it possible to run it on &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; hardware(I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to end up using it on my own machine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemd, a somewhat controversial init system is de-facto standard in the Linux world and it is important to keep that in mind. The init system I&amp;rsquo;m going to develop will provide an interface familiar for a person coming from &amp;lsquo;systemd&amp;rsquo; background and on top of that the service specification is going to be done in Systemd unit-file format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The init system itself does not seem to be too hard to implement and so I will probably spend a lot of time working on the IPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I have implemented &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; and fixed an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/plasma-umass/browsix/pull/30&#34;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;code&gt;rm -r&lt;/code&gt; flag for Browsix shell, both were done in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.typescriptlang.org/&#34;&gt;Typescript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
