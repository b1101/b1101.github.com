      <p>Probably it&rsquo;s time to start writing some proper text on the topic and not some random <em>&lsquo;stuff&rsquo;</em>. Ok, so the little research project I worked for(I will still have to go back to set up everything properly :/) indeed turned out to be a very good intro to Go(and I even had to write a Systemd unit file, specifying network dep). Also, by having to implement the web-interface,work with JSON and utilise HTTP requests, my understanding of the frontend-backend communication became much clearer(well, I did not have any experience with that before) and now I understand the benefits Browsix provides even better.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/coreos/go-systemd">Go-systemd</a> by <a href="https://coreos.com/">Core OS</a> provide some very useful functionality for the init system I&rsquo;m going to work on. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m going to use the &lsquo;unit&rsquo; package for parsing the unit files. (<em>It&rsquo;s good to learn from mistakes - while developing the research project I wrote all the API bindings from scratch, only to discover 3 already developed after finishing - on the other hand it was a great learning experience</em>)</p>

<p>The init system &lsquo;keeps seeming&rsquo; to be a very easy task and I start to get worried, trying to find the &lsquo;catch&rsquo; - there should be something I did not think about&hellip; I am starting to think I will spend much more time on IPC during the project. On the other hand, even while the task itself may (seem to) be easy, the important part is to write maintainable, well-structured code, and, as I discovered while working on the research project - proper organization and defining a proper structure for the project turned out to be not as easy as I thought(at least for me). I re-wrote my code 3 times and I still am not satisfied fully(some parts were good the 1st try, though, so I kept them)</p>
