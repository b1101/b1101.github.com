I managed to calm myself down and give the project a new 'fresh' look. I came to a conclusion, that it's not that bad at all. I did start major reorganisation of things, but now I also write tests and add comments on the way, as it looks like I am not going to make any significant changes to the structure anymore. This week I spent most of my time thinking and writing code on paper, but it was very beneficial regardless.
