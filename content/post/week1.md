The first week of GSoC is over. Turned out to be kind of long for me, as I could not wait until Monday and started working on Saturday evening already. <!--more-->

It goes pretty well, I'd say. Already managed to rewrite a lot of code I initially wrote, but units get properly parsed and some of them even get started, but most importantly I now know exactly what my next steps should be.

One of the biggest issues for me is coming up with a proper structure. I spend most of my time sitting with a pen and a paper, drawing and trying to understand, how should everything be connected, how shall I organize it. The code itself seems to be really straight-forward, though. I hope now I came up with a structure that somewhat makes sense. I already see things that could(should) be changed/improved, but currently I decided to move forward and then come back to organization, when more stuff works and the requirements are clearer.

Actually I'm pretty new to Golang -- this is only my 2nd experience with it. The first one was a research project I worked on for 1.5 weeks before the start of GSoC. I found the interface-based inheritance in Go to be really interesting concept, it really does make you think forward and structure everything properly and, while I still miss some of the 'proper' inhertitance features(I can't stop wanting 1 method on the parent 'class', which all the children would inherit, for example), it seems to be somewhat 'better' and I start to like it.

By the way, the Go standard library and tooling are incredible.
